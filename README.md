# NatureFox

A fork of FlyingFox.
It has just a few modifications to the code and the look of FlyingFox, with a configuration of nightTab.
The green color look is just for dark theme of Firefox. If you choose light theme I'm sorry of your eyes.

You can <a href="http://flyingfox.netlify.app">visit the app</a> of FlyingFox to customize.</h5>

**It doesn't work well in Firefox 89.**
